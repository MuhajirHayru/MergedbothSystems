"""Event-driven control flow (doc 4.11.2).

Domain events fire through Django signals and are the single trigger for
notification generation.  Views therefore never import ``notify`` directly for
these events, which keeps the workflows declarative and makes the event stream
easy to extend (e.g. adding an SMS gateway later) without touching business
logic.

Event catalogue:

============================  ==========================================
``user_registered``           A new PENDING account entered the queue.
``user_approved``             A User Admin approved a registration.
``user_rejected``             A User Admin rejected a registration.
``payment_submitted``         A wholesaler submitted a payment record.
``payment_verified``          A Financial Manager verified a payment.
``payment_flagged``           A Financial Manager flagged a discrepancy.
``order_created``             A wholesaler placed a procurement order.
``message_received``          A chat message was persisted.
